## What is DEVONthink Pro for macOS?

DEVONthink Pro is a **comprehensive and intelligent document management system** developed exclusively for macOS. It serves as a centralized hub for storing, organizing, and retrieving a wide variety of data types—including PDFs, emails, images, spreadsheets, and notes—using machine learning and natural language processing.

The application is available in three tiers:  
- **DEVONthink Personal** – tailored for individual use.  
- **DEVONthink Pro** – equipped with advanced database and automation features.  
- **DEVONthink Server** – enables multi-user collaboration and sync.  

One of the standout features of DEVONthink Pro is its AI engine, which understands the content of your documents, suggests relevant connections, and can even summarize long texts. It supports strong encryption, AppleScript automation, and syncs via iCloud, Dropbox, or its own secure sync service.

Fully compatible with **macOS Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, and Big Sur**, DEVONthink Pro is optimized for both Intel-based Macs and Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3). It integrates deeply with the macOS ecosystem, supporting features like Dark Mode, Split View, and Continuity.

Ideal for students, academics, professionals, and anyone who deals with large amounts of digital information, DEVONthink Pro turns chaos into order—helping you build a searchable, private, and intelligent knowledge base.
